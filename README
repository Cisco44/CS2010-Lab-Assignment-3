Lab Assignment 3: Computer Memory Simulation

To Build:
	$ make

To Run:
	$ ./LabAss3

Purpose:

The main function of this program is to simulate computer memory.

The program begins by prompting the user for the maximum size of the storage. This cannot be a negative number.
If the user attempts to input a negative number the program will simple prompt the user to input a positive
number until one is inputted.

Afterwards it will list the location in the storage and prompt the user to input an integer in the storage in
the following form "X: ", where X is an integer representing the storage location.

The program will then prompt the user for a location from which he would like to retrieve an integer.

It will then ask the user to enter locations he wishes to copy from, copy to, and how much he would like to copy.

Lastly the program will dump a memory range specified by the user, followed by the entire memory.
